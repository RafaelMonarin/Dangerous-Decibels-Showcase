**Dangerous Decibels** is a mobile educational game designed to raise awareness about **hearing health** and the risks of exposure to loud sounds. The game combines fun, interactive mini-games with important lessons about protecting your hearing.

## ✨ Game Concept

The game consists of multiple mini-games, each teaching players about **different aspects of hearing and the dangers of high-volume environments**. Players can select mini-games from the menu to practice and improve their understanding of safe listening habits.

A central **game wheel** limits the time for each session. The player must complete as many mini-games as possible **before time runs out** or **before making mistakes that end the round**. This adds both challenge and urgency while reinforcing educational content.

Each mini-game awards **points**, and the **highest score achieved is saved** to encourage replay and improvement.
